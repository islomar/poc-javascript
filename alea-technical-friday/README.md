## Summary
* Hide and show elements

* Hoisting (elevar, alzar, levantar):
 * It is a concept about program load order.
 * Function expressions vs function statements
   * A **Function Expression** defines a function as a part of a larger expression syntax (typically a variable assignment )
    * A **Function Declaration/Statements** defines a named function variable without requiring variable assignment. 
 * A function statement can be invoked during execution before its actual definition. 
  * This happens because before the code runs, function statements are interpreted and added to the execution stack/tcontext.
 * Function expressions are never hoisted, they are treated as assignments.

* Is a number really a number?

* Global variables

* Objects
 
* IIFE: Inmediately Invoked Function Expression

* Module pattern

* Inheritance and prototyping

* Invocation patterns

* For the second part:
 * JS is function scope.
 * var MYAPP = MYAPP || {};
 * Explanation objects.js, line 56 >> what 'this' is bound to, why loopy.xxxx didn't work.
 * IIFE
 * Module pattern
 * Invocation patterns
 * Examples in Alea
  * class 'hide': presenters.js, views.js
  * inheritance: XEMA.View.Base
